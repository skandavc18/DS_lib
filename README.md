# DS_lib

This library consists of 8 Data Structures for C with their respective operations like insertion, deletion, search, traverse,etc.

The example C files have been put for easy reference. 

The 8 Data Structures are 

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Doubly Linked List
4. Vector
5. Dictionary
6. Heap
7. AVL Tree
8. Matrix

All of them are dynamically adjust sizes as and when necessary and support all standard C Data types.Though Dynamically Adjusting size can affect time complexity to some extent (like rehashing in Dictionary), still a significant amount of space can be conserved. A space-time tradeoff. Also it won't affect time to a significant extent.

The Library has been developed using Macros. And all the functions reside in the header files of the respective data structure. So just the respective header file has to be included and the functions can be used.
