# DS_lib

This is generic library which consists of 8 Data Structures for C with their respective operations like insertion, deletion, search, traverse,etc.

The example C files have been put for easy reference. 

The 8 Data Structures are 

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Doubly Linked List
4. Vector
5. Dictionary
6. Heap
7. AVL Tree
8. Matrix

All of them can dynamically adjust sizes as and when necessary and support all standard C Data types.Though Dynamically Adjusting size can affect performance to some extent (like rehashing in Dictionary), the impact is negligible and a significant amount of space can be conserved.

The Library has been developed using Macros. And all the functions reside in the header files of the respective data structure. So just the respective header file has to be included and the functions can be used.
